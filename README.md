# Introducing the Team member Allocation app.

In this app you can add members to different teams by selecting the team in the drop down and in the teams page you can see the members each team as selected by you.

This app is built using React and Bootstrap 5. 
The navigation bar is made using the react router. It has local storage support so even after the page is refreshed the app starts from where you left it.
